# The Hayghin Daedric Script

This is a simple Daedric character font based upon [Ayembedt](https://github.com/georgd/OpenMW-Fonts) for the letter glyphs, the number system documented by [Llevndryn Sershilavu](https://arador-dayn.fr/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=482) (a.k.a. *Naka*), and some additional punctuation marks from [Source Han Serif](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif) to produce a font that is somewhat comfortable to read and write with.

The word *hayghin* comes from [Casual Dumneris](https://casualscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Dunmeri_language) and means *simple*, to denote the sparse features of this font. I have admittedly only added glyphs that suit my needs in Markdown.
