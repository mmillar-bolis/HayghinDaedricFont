# The Hayghin Daedric Script

This is a simple Daedric character font based upon [Ayembedt][1] for the letter glyphs, the number system documented by [Llevndryn Sershilavu][2] (a.k.a. *Naka*), and some additional punctuation marks from [Source Han Serif][3] to produce a font that is somewhat comfortable to read and write with.

The word *hayghin* comes from [Casual Dumneris][4] and means *simple*, to denote the sparse features of this font. I have admittedly only added glyphs that suit my needs in Markdown.
